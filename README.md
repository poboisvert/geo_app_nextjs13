Next.js 13.4 - Page, Layout, Router, and Middleware
This repository showcases the usage of Next.js 13.4 to build dynamic web applications with features like page rendering, layout components, router, and middleware.

Features
Page Rendering: Next.js 13.4 provides an intuitive and efficient way to render pages in your web application. The pages directory structure and file-based routing system make it easy to create and organize your pages.

Layout Components: You can create reusable layout components to provide consistent design and structure across multiple pages. These layout components can be easily integrated into your Next.js application, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.

Router: Next.js 13.4 includes a powerful router that allows you to define client-side navigation and handle dynamic routing. With the router, you can handle different URLs and parameters to display the appropriate content for each page.

Middleware: The middleware feature in Next.js 13.4 enables you to add custom logic and functionality before rendering a page. You can leverage middleware to perform tasks such as language detection, geolocation, or URL rewriting, enhancing the flexibility and extensibility of your application.
